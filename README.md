# TMDB_Search

This simple project allows you to search for a film and see the detail card. The TMDB APIs are used. Up to 10 completed queries are registered and the search is paginated.
In this project you can see how Pattern Coordinator (SceneCoordinator) in Rx is elegant and minimal. 
While for architecture I used MVVM with RXSwift for the power and speed of writing. In this project it was used for Realm persistence. The Http request is used Moya in Rx. And for Unit-Test I used Quick, Nimble and RxBlocking.
